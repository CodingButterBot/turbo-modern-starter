  Dev Log #1, May 5th, 2025, initial project setup.

  I'm working on establishing the developer audio log system for the turbo-modern-starter project, focusing on creating a structured way to document development progress.

  So far, I've created the dev_log directory, established a clear file naming convention with timestamps and issue references, and documented the log structure in CLAUDE.md. I've also added a README.md to the dev_log folder explaining its purpose and organization.

  The main challenge was determining the most effective structure for short audio logs that balance completeness with brevity. I've settled on a 60-90 second format with six key components.

  Next, I'll be looking at the assigned GitHub issues to identify which tasks to prioritize. I'll focus on extension build issues as indicated by the current branch name.

### [21:08:56] TypeScript Setup Assessment

  Dev Log #2, May 5th, 2025, regarding issue #79 - TypeScript setup assessment.

  I've been analyzing the TypeScript conversion status for the extension and the build process workflow. The extension has largely been converted to TypeScript, with properly configured tsconfig.json and TypeScript dependencies in package.json.

  So far, I've examined the vite.config.ts file, which handles the build process, and it's properly configured to copy the manifest.json and assets to the dist folder. The build process includes a post-build script that ensures HTML files are created with proper paths, and a verification script confirms all required files exist.

  The main challenge is that the background.js and directus-sdk-background.js files are still in JavaScript and use importScripts which could be converted to TypeScript modules. Also, the build process requires multiple steps with both the main Vite build and custom scripts.

  Next, I'll analyze the remaining extension issues more deeply, particularly focusing on side panel implementation (issue #59) and the missing extension icons (issue #70). I'll also explore options for improving the build process, perhaps consolidating the verification steps.

  Dev Log #3, May 5th, 2025, regarding issues #59, #70, and the extension build process.

  I've completed a comprehensive analysis of the extension build process and its TypeScript conversion status. The extension build is working properly with all required files being copied to the dist directory. The TypeScript conversion is mostly complete, with only the background.js and directus-sdk-background.js files remaining in JavaScript.

  For the side panel implementation, issue #59, I found that it's already well implemented with proper React components and styling. It's correctly registered in the manifest.json and the build process handles it properly. PR #60 has been submitted for this feature.

  Regarding the missing extension icons, issue #70, all the required icons now exist in both PNG and SVG formats in the public/icons directory, and they're correctly copied to the dist folder during build. This issue appears to be resolved.

  I've documented all my findings in a detailed FINDINGS.md file in the extension directory, including recommendations for further improvements. Next, I'll create a plan for converting the remaining JavaScript files to TypeScript, focusing on the service worker files.

### [21:24:49] Dev Log Reorganization

  Dev Log #4, May 5th, 2025, regarding dev log organization and GitHub branch cleanup.

  I've restructured the dev_log system to follow a more organized approach with a year-month/day folder structure. Each day now has a consolidated log.md file containing timestamps, transcripts, and links to audio files and GitHub issues.

  I've updated the CLAUDE.md file with the new organization requirements, including proper instructions for using \n instead of \\n in text-to-speech parameters. The README.md in the dev_log directory has also been updated to reflect the new structure.

  The main challenge was ensuring proper linking between log entries, audio files, and GitHub issues while maintaining a clean folder structure that will scale well over time.

  Next, I'll be looking at cleaning up the GitHub branch list, which has become unwieldy. I'll identify old branches that can be deleted and pull requests that should be merged or closed to maintain a cleaner project structure.
  ```

## Summary of Work
Today's focus was on analyzing the extension build process and TypeScript conversion status. Key accomplishments:

1. Set up the dev_log system with organized structure and audio logs
2. Analyzed TypeScript conversion status for the extension (issue #79)
3. Reviewed side panel implementation (issue #59)
4. Verified extension icons status (issue #70)
5. Created detailed documentation on findings (FINDINGS.md)
6. Developed a TypeScript conversion plan for remaining JavaScript files (TS_CONVERSION_PLAN.md)
7. Reorganized the dev_log system with improved folder structure and linking

## Next Steps
- Clean up GitHub branches and merge/close outdated PRs
- Convert background.js and directus-sdk-background.js to TypeScript
- Continue implementing improvements to the extension build process
