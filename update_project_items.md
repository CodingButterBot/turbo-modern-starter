# Project Item Status Update Instructions

This document explains how to update the status of items in the GitHub project board.

## Current Status

After reviewing the project board, the following items have been identified with missing status values:

| Number | Title | Current Status | Recommended Status | Justification |
|--------|-------|----------------|-------------------|---------------|
| #61 | Implement extension UI component library | (none) | Done | Implementation is complete and PR #64 has been submitted |
| #62 | Add i18n support to browser extension | (none) | Todo | Work hasn't started yet but is planned |
| #63 | Implement extension data synchronization | (none) | Todo | Work hasn't started yet but is planned |
| #64 (PR) | Implement extension UI component library | (none) | Pending Review | PR is submitted and waiting for review |
| #65 | Standardize GitHub project workflow | (none) | In Progress | Work has started with PR #66 but more tasks remain |
| #66 (PR) | Add GitHub project workflow guidelines | (none) | Pending Review | PR is submitted and waiting for review |
| #67 (PR) | Add GitHub project management automation | (none) | Pending Review | PR is submitted and waiting for review |

## Updating Status Values

You can update these status values using the provided Python script:

```bash
# First, set your GitHub token as an environment variable
export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token

# Then run the script
python3 update_project_statuses.py
```

The script will update all project items with their recommended status values.

## GitHub Project Status Values

The project has the following status options:

- **Todo**: Work that is planned but not yet started
- **In Progress**: Work that is actively being done
- **Pending Review**: Work that has a PR and is awaiting review
- **Done**: Work that is completed and merged
- **On Hold**: Work that is paused or blocked

## Manual Updates

If you prefer to update the status values manually, you can do this through the GitHub UI:

1. Go to the [project board](https://github.com/users/CodingButterBot/projects/4)
2. Find the item you want to update
3. Click on the status dropdown in the Status column
4. Select the appropriate status

## Workflow Automation

The PR #67 includes a GitHub Actions workflow that can automate this process in the future. After merging that PR, you can run the workflow to keep project statuses up to date.
