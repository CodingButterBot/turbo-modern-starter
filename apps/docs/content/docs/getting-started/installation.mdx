# Installation

This guide will help you set up the Turbo Modern Starter monorepo for local development.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v18 or later)
- **pnpm** (v8 or later)
- **Git**
- **Docker** (optional, for Directus CMS)

## Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodingButterBot/turbo-modern-starter.git
cd turbo-modern-starter
```

## Install Dependencies

The monorepo uses pnpm workspaces to manage dependencies across all packages and apps.

```bash
pnpm install
```

This command installs all dependencies for all packages and apps in the monorepo.

## Development Setup

After installation, you can run various commands to develop, test, and build the project.

### Start Development Servers

To start all development servers in parallel:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

This will start:
- The web app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- The documentation site at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001)
- The extension builder in watch mode

### Run Specific Apps

To run just one app, use the `--filter` flag:

```bash
# Run just the web app
pnpm dev --filter web

# Run just the docs site
pnpm dev --filter docs

# Build just the extension
pnpm dev --filter extension
```

## Building for Production

To build all apps and packages for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

This builds all packages and apps in the correct dependency order.

## Running Directus (Optional)

If you want to use the Directus CMS backend:

```bash
cd apps/directus
docker-compose up -d
```

This starts Directus at [http://localhost:8055](http://localhost:8055) with default credentials:
- Email: admin@example.com
- Password: password123
