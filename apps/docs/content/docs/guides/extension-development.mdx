# Browser Extension Development

The Turbo Modern Starter includes a browser extension that provides the module functionality in a convenient popup interface.

## Technology Stack

The extension is built with:

- **React** - UI library
- **Vite** - Build tool
- **@crxjs/vite-plugin** - Extension bundling
- **Tailwind CSS** - Styling
- **Manifest V3** - Chrome extension format

## Development Workflow

### Starting Development

To work on the extension:

```bash
# From the root directory
pnpm dev --filter extension

# Or directly from the extension directory
cd apps/extension
pnpm dev
```

This starts a build in watch mode, which will rebuild the extension whenever you make changes.

### Loading in Chrome

After building the extension:

1. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
2. Enable "Developer mode" using the toggle in the top-right corner
3. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `dist` directory inside `apps/extension/`
4. The extension should now appear in your extensions list and toolbar

### Reloading During Development

After making changes:

1. Wait for the rebuild to complete
2. Go to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Click the reload icon on the extension card
4. Open the extension popup to see your changes

## Extension Structure

```
apps/extension/
├─ public/           # Static assets like icons
├─ src/
│  ├─ components/    # UI components
│  ├─ PopupApp.tsx   # Main popup UI
│  ├─ index.css      # Tailwind imports
│  └─ main.tsx       # React entry point
├─ manifest.json     # Extension manifest
├─ index.html        # HTML entry point
└─ vite.config.ts    # Vite configuration
```

## Using Shared Packages

The extension uses the same shared packages as the web app:

```tsx
// Example: Using the RandomModule from @repo/module
import { RandomModule } from "@repo/module";

const module = new RandomModule(options);
const winner = module.spin();
```

## Building for Production

To create a production build:

```bash
pnpm build --filter extension
```

This creates a production-ready extension in the `apps/extension/dist` directory, which you can:

1. Load as an unpacked extension for testing
2. Zip for submission to the Chrome Web Store or Firefox Add-ons

## Debugging Tips

1. **Access the Console**: Right-click the extension popup and select "Inspect" to open DevTools
2. **Background Script Debugging**: Go to `chrome://extensions/`, find your extension, and click "background page" under "Inspect views"
3. **Manifest Issues**: Chrome will show warnings in `chrome://extensions/` if there are problems with your manifest.json

## Distribution

To package the extension for distribution:

1. Build the extension with `pnpm build --filter extension`
2. Zip the contents of the `dist` directory
3. Upload to the Chrome Web Store Developer Dashboard or Firefox Add-ons Portal
