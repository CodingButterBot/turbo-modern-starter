# Pull Request Analysis for Consolidation

## Overview
To consolidate the repository down to just main and a single working branch, we need to carefully analyze each PR to determine what changes to keep, merge, or discard.

## PR Analysis

**Key Features**:
- Base extension structure

### PR #60: Add side panel to browser extension
**Status**: Important extension feature that builds on PR #58.

## Consolidation Plan

### Step 1: Merge Base Extension PRs
1. Merge PR #58 (basic extension) to main
2. Merge PR #60 (side panel) to main

### Step 2: Create New Focused Branch
1. Create new branch `feature/extension-typescript` from main
2. Cherry-pick commits from our current branch that fix build issues and add TypeScript:
   - 5790bbc Remove deprecated JavaScript files now that TypeScript conversion is complete
   - a0f0628 Fix theme system with improved dark mode support
   - d7acae0 feat: close popup window when opening side panel
   - ad0f15d Update extension.zip with latest changes

### Step 3: Delete Unnecessary Branches
1. Close PRs #67, #68, and #77 without merging
2. Delete all local branches except main and our new focused branch
3. Clean up remote branches that have been consolidated

### Step 4: Focus on TypeScript Conversion
With a clean branch structure, focus on completing the extension TypeScript conversion as outlined in TS_CONVERSION_PLAN.md.
